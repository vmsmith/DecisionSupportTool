#### Introduction  

In Michael Lewis's book, [The Undoing Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Undoing_Project), he details the collaboration between two Israeli psychologists, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Kahneman and Tversky are known for developing [Prospect Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory) as well as for their work on heuristics and cognitive biases.

One point that comes out in the book is that before there is a decision, there is a judgement.

In investing, we often focus on the judgement, e.g., the valuation of an investment, and not so much on *the decision* whether or not to actually invest.

This document is an initial attempt to develop a tool for making the decision whether or not to invest *after* the judgement (valuation) has been made. As such, it is not meant to replace any methods or tools an investor might already have; rather, it is meant to augment those methods and tools.
