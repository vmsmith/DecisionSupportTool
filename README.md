#### Introduction  

In Michael Lewis's book, [The Undoing Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Undoing_Project), the author details the collaboration between two Israeli psychologists, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Kahneman and Tversky are known for developing [Prospect Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory) as well as for their work on heuristics and cognitive biases.

One point that comes out in the book is that before there is a decision, there is a judgement.

In investing, we often focus on the judgement, e.g., the valuation of an investment, and not so much on *the decision* whether or not to actually invest.

This project is an attempt to develop a tool for helping make the decision whether or not to invest *after* the judgement (valuation) has been made. As such, it assumes some sort of valuation has been made. It is not meant to replace any methods or tools an investor might already have; rather, it is meant to augment those methods and tools.

The project will proceed in two phases:
* Phase I: Developing a decision model for determining the expected value (EV) of an investment compared to an alternative investment.
* Phase II: Developing a Bayesian or Bayesian-like model for updating the probabilities used to determine EVs.
