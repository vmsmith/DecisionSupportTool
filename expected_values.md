#### Scenario #1  

Imagine a farmer in Kansas trying to decide whether to plant soybeans or wheat. In previous years he planted soybeans and did quite well selling them to China. This year, however, the is sabre rattling between the U.S. and China, and the threat of a trade war looms. In the case of a trade war, he would probably not do well planting soybeans.

There are several elements to consider.

First, the farmer has two *courses of action*. These are thing the farmer can control: plant soybeans, or plant wheat.

Second, there are two possible *states of nature*. These are things the farmer cannot control: there is a trade war, or there is not a trade war.

The farmer begins by organizing the courses of action and the states of nature in a 2 x 2 matrix:

<table>
  <tr><td></td><td>No Trade War</td><td>Trade War</td><td>EV</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Plant Soybeans</td><td>No Trade War</td><td>Trade War</td><td>EV</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Plant Wheat</td><td>No Trade War</td><td>Trade War</td><td>EV</td></tr>
</table>
